# About

## About this library
This library works with Django and can authenticate users with SSS-Extension.
The server uses the SSS-Extension authentication function and can perform a secure login.

## About the authentication mechanism
The library performs authentication as follows: For DH key negotiation, this is done using encrypted messages used in the Symbol-SDK.
1. The server sends a request to the user to create a token by sending the server's public key.
2. The user uses the server's public key to create a cryptographic token through a DH key agreement.
3. The server receives the encrypted token and decrypts it using the server's private key.
4. Login is done by comparing the Symbol's pre-registered address (login information list) with the decryption result.

## Information is stored on the server
The server stores the following information as login information: It does not store user passwords.
- Symbol address
- Email (optional)

Save the following settings on the server for authentication: The private key you use should only be used to authenticate the server and should not be used for any other purpose.
- Symbol server secret key
- Network type used for authentication

## About SSS resolution
Because sssauth requires permission to access SSS, you must grant permission to the web page before using it.
After accessing the web page, right-click > select "Link to SSS".
